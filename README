Geometry in Ruby
================

Implementation of basic geometry algorithms and types.

Already implemented algorithms
==============================
  * Does segment contain point?  { Segment.contains_point? }
  * Are segments parralel? { Segment.parallel_to? }
  * Are vectors collinear? { Vector.collinear_with? }
  * Vectors cross product (outer product, vector product) { Vector.cross_product }
  * Vectors scalar product (inner product, dot product) { Vector.scalar_product }
  * Segment length { Segment.length }
  * Vector modulus { Vector.modulus }
  * Euclid distance { Geometry.distance }

Coming up
=========
  
  * Do segments intersect?
  * Segments intersection point
  * Trivial vector arithmetics
  * Does polygon contain point?
