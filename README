Geometry in Ruby
================

Implementation of basic geometry algorithms and types.

Already implemented algorithms
==============================
  * Does segment contain point? (Segment.contains_point?)
  * Are segments parralel? (Segment.parallel_to?)
  * Are vectors collinear? (Vector.collinear_with?)
  * Euclid distance (Geometry.distance)

Coming up
=========  
  * Do segments intersect?
  * Segments intersection point
  * Trivial vector arithmetics
  * Does polygon contain point?
