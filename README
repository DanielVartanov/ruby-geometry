Geometry in Ruby
================

Implementation of basic 2D geometry algorithms in Ruby.


Already implemented algorithms
==============================

  * Do segments intersect? { Segment.intersects_with? }

  * Segments intersection point { Segment.intersection_point_with }

  * Does segment contain given point?  { Segment.contains_point? }

  * Are segments parallel? { Segment.parallel_to? }

  * Are vectors collinear? { Vector.collinear_with? }

  * Vectors cross product (outer product, vector product) { Vector.cross_product }

  * Vectors scalar product (inner product, dot product) { Vector.scalar_product }

  * Segment length { Segment.length }

  * Vector modulus { Vector.modulus }

  * Euclid distance { Geometry.distance }


Coming up
=========      

  * Trivial vector arithmetics

  * Does polygon contain given point?
